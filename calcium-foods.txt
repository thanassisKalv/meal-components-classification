Calcium can also be found in other dairy foods like yogurt and cheese, in tofu made with calcium, in canned salmon and sardines (if bones are eaten), in some leafy greens (collards and spinach), in soybeans and green soybeans (edamame), and in calcium-fortified foods and drinks like soymilk, other plant-based “milks,” orange juice, and cereals. The amount of calcium in these other foods vary.
